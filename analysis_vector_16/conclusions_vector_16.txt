Conclusions for Vector Size 16:
==================================================

1. Impact of Sparsity: As sparsity increases (from 50% to 95%), cycle count decreases by 60.3%

2. Impact of Stride (compared to Stride=1):

   - Stride=2: -2.7% decrease in cycles

   - Stride=3: 0.2% increase in cycles

   - Stride=4: -44.7% decrease in cycles

3. Best Configuration: Sparsity=95.0%, Stride=4.0, Cycles=4103916

4. Worst Configuration: Sparsity=50.0%, Stride=3.0, Cycles=10619670
