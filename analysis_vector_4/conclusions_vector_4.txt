Conclusions for Vector Size 4:
==================================================

1. Impact of Sparsity: As sparsity increases (from 50% to 95%), cycle count decreases by 41.2%

2. Impact of Stride (compared to Stride=1):

   - Stride=2: 2.5% increase in cycles

   - Stride=3: 1.2% increase in cycles

   - Stride=4: -25.5% decrease in cycles

3. Best Configuration: Sparsity=95.0%, Stride=2.0, Cycles=3872872

4. Worst Configuration: Sparsity=50.0%, Stride=1.0, Cycles=6699105
