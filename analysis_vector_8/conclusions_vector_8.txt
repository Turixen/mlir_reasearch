Conclusions for Vector Size 8:
==================================================

1. Impact of Sparsity: As sparsity increases (from 50% to 95%), cycle count decreases by 43.3%

2. Impact of Stride (compared to Stride=1):

   - Stride=2: 2.2% increase in cycles

   - Stride=3: 0.5% increase in cycles

   - Stride=4: -28.5% decrease in cycles

3. Best Configuration: Sparsity=95.0%, Stride=4.0, Cycles=3843625

4. Worst Configuration: Sparsity=50.0%, Stride=1.0, Cycles=6927601
